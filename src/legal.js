### Signing Date: {{ DATE_TIME }}

Thank you for your interest Cryptogogue, Inc.’s Volition blockchain project! If you would like to participate in Our open beta, you must agree to these Open Beta General Terms of Service (the “**TOS**”). 

These terms establish your general commitment to work with third parties to access the Volition blockchain and our Volition wallet (which we refer to as “**VOLWAL**”). The specific services we provide hereunder is merely access to the Volition blockchain (referred to as the “**Services**”). The TOS are a binding agreement between you, the downloader or copier, or installer, or otherwise the user of any portion the Services (“**You**” or “**Your**” or similar pronouns) and Cryptogogue, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“**Cryptogogue**” or “**We**” or “**Us**” or similar pronouns). Additional terms with third-party nodes (or miners) or other third-party services are likely required for your full use and enjoyment of the Volition blockchain. Please read these TOS (and any other third party terms) carefully! 

1. **Volition Blockchain Background.** We, Cryptogogue, are a software development company that produces products supporting the Volition blockchain. A Volition blockchain is any blockchain formatted according to the rules of the Volition blockchain protocol, which specifies its structure and the methods by which it may be extended by multiple parties in a Byzantine fault-tolerant manner. There may be many Volition blockchains operating independently, but for the purposes of this document, we will refer to them all as “the” blockchain. Cryptogogue’s open-source products include self-hosted server software intended for use by third parties (again, we call these third parties “miners” or “nodes”) wishing to participate in maintaining the blockchain and an open-source reference wallet called VOLWAL that may be used to create and submit transactions to the blockchain and to query the state of the distributed ledger the blockchain represents. The blockchain itself consists of blocks stored as digital files containing transactions. Transactions represent discreet changes to the ledger. The ledger is the application state derived from applying all transactions in the blockchain to a database. In other words, transactions are recorded on the blockchain and applied to the ledger. To be recorded, all transactions must be signed by a private key associated with a public key already known to the ledger. When a public key registered to the ledger, an “account” is created. Accounts may optionally be given unique names and are used to further associate records of value (such as balances of fungible cryptocurrencies and inventories of non-fungible “Assets”) with public keys. In other words, the holder of the corresponding private keys “owns” the assets in an account, even if their individual identity is not known. Fungible cryptocurrencies (such as “VOL”) are represented as simple numeric balances within accounts. Non-Fungible assets are identified by unique identifiers. A digital asset is tracked through every change of ownership. Digital assets are also associated with data records and content. Typically, digital assets represent transferrable licenses that grant rights to their owners, such as the right to access specific content for the license holder’s personal use. How these licenses may be used or redeemed may vary and should be described in a separate terms of service style document for each project. It is very important that end users of Cryptogogue’s products understand that the blockchain itself is maintained by third parties, and that the use of VOLWAL may also be self-hosted by You or hosted by third parties. In these cases, these TOS may not fully address the legal relationship between any two third parties, or You and a third-party, individually using Cryptogogue’s products. It is also important that You understand that the “ownership” of a license represented by a digital asset is only provable via the digital signature of a private key. If the key is lost or if the asset is transferred to another account by mistake, there is no way to recover it. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in some separate terms of service or agreement, asset transfers are irreversible once recorded. Finally, end users should understand that licenses may specify additional responsibilities on the end user upon transfer, such as destroying any hard copies of licensed content.
2. **Eligibility.** The Services are offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. The Services are not targeted towards or intended for use by children under the age of 13. By using these Services, You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with us and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If You do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Services.  
3. **Changes.** We reserve the right to change or amend the TOS, and any of its terms and conditions, at any time. We will include the date of when the change was last updated at the top, but reserve the right to have changes with retroactive implications. Continued use of Services after a change constitutes agreement to any such changes. You are expected to check back regularly in case of changes.
4. **Privacy.** We do not actively collect or store any of your personally identifying information; **however**, You understand and acknowledge that any transactions you send to the Volition mining network may be stored indefinitely in a distributed ledger, publicly accessible to anyone and that certain aspects of your account (such as your public key) may come to be associated directly with You. Do not send any transactions containing information that You expect to remain private or use the Volition blockchain if failing to remain anonymous would cause You harm.
5. **Open Beta Summary.** The Services are being offered as an open beta test that is not meant to be the official launch of the Services and is instead meant to be a testing environment (the “**Open** **Beta**”). We are looking forward to testing the Services, assets, software, user interaction with the software, and other aspects and would appreciate your feedback on all of it! We have not determined how long the Open Beta will run. Accordingly, and because this is an open and limited test, we **MAY END THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME**. Further, the Assets (defined below) and Vol acquired during the Open Beta may cease to exist at the end of Open Beta and may no longer be accessible or useable following the end of Open Beta. We may or may not provide equivalent Assets, Vol, or any other item to You in exchange for acquired Vol or Assets at the close of Open Beta, and do not promise to carry over into any future release or use of the Services or Volition. 
6. **Account.** Agreement to these terms means that you will have the opportunity to provide a public key that will be recorded on a public and distributed ledger. You will have a private key associated with your public key which together is an “account.” Accordingly, every account on the Volition blockchain is associated with one or more cryptographic key pairs.
- **a. Digital Signature**. Your use constitutes acceptance of these TOS and constitutes your “signature” and acceptance through a private key of any key pair in your control. By publishing the resulting “signature” to the Volition blockchain (either yourself or through a node or other agent), even without identifying yourself, you acknowledge that (a) you are a user of the Volition blockchain; (b) you have read these TOS and agree to the terms herein; (c) the digital signature is your legally binding signature; and (d) in any legal action arising between you and Cryptogogue, Inc. or any user(s) of the Volition blockchain, you will make the identity of your blockchain account known to all named parties.
- **b. Unique Account.** Please keep your private key private. We are not responsible for any loss or misuse of your private keys. 
- **c. Interactions between Users.** We are in no way responsible for Your interactions with other users. We do not screen, vet, verify, or in any way actively warrant or condone the actions of other users of the Services. You understand that you are responsible for all of your actions and the interactions and use of your account with others. 
7. **VOLWAL.** While We do offer an open-source software blockchain wallet, VOLWAL, the terms of using VOLWAL are not included under these TOS. Accordingly, before downloading the VOLWAL software, if You choose to do so, You will be required to agree to the specific terms of using the VOLWAL software. It is your responsibility to review, read and agree to those separate terms before using VOLWAL. 
8. **Third Party Interactions.** The Services may permit you to link to other websites or resources on the internet, and other websites or resources may contain links to our websites. When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. Those other websites are not under the Our control, and you acknowledge that we are not liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness, or any other aspect of those other websites or resources. The inclusion on another website of any link to or from Our websites does not imply endorsement by or affiliation with Us. You further acknowledge and agree that the We are not liable for any damage related to the use of any content, goods, or services available through any third-party website or resource.
9. **Assets and VOL.**
- **a. Assets and VOL.** By using the Services, you may acquire non-fungible cryptographic assets (“**Assets**”) and/or units of Our cryptocurrency referred to as “**Vol**”. You acknowledge and agree that VOL and any Assets are strictly for entertainment purposes only and have no monetary value. You shall not represent to any third party that Assets and VOL will ever have any monetary value or will ever be redeemable for money or any other asset.
- **b. Trading.** You may trade Assets or Vol with other Open Beta users *only for other Assets and VOL*. 
- **c. Asset Use,** Printing and Digital. During Open Beta, you may print or cause to be printed physical copies of any Assets associated with your account for your own personal use, including use in tournaments and organized play events.  Further, you may make digital copies of any Assets associated with your account for your own personal use, including use in tournaments and organized play events
- **d. User Artwork.** As part of Open Beta, you will have the opportunity to publish artwork on the Volition blockchain. More specifically, you will have the opportunity to publish the URL of your original artwork on the Volition blockchain, with the artwork itself being hosted by You or a third party (referred to as “**User** **Artwork**”). For the purposes of the TOS, "publishing a URL of artwork" means "publishing the artwork found at the given URL at the time of submission." Should you publish User Artwork, you represent that you are the exclusive owner of the User Artwork and that you have full authority to distribute and license the artwork for any purpose. By publishing User Artwork on the Volition blockchain, you grant to Us a license in perpetuity to use your artwork (and all derivative works thereof) in print and digital media anywhere in the world for the specific purpose of promoting the Volition collectible card game and the Volition blockchain. This license to Us DOES NOT include a license to sell or publish that artwork (physically or digitally) as part of a standalone commercial offering for your User Artwork. Through transactions recorded on the Volition blockchain, your artwork may be associated with specific non-fungible Assets. In this event, you grant a transferrable license, or sublicense as the case may be, to the any holder of such Assets to print or cause to be printed physical copies of said Assets (and your artwork) for their own personal use, including use in tournaments and organized play events. You give permission to any user of the Volition blockchain to store a digital copy of your artwork indefinitely and to make that digital copy available to the public for download and display, provided the artwork is made available unmodified in its entirety and offered for no commercial, personal or promotional purpose. Specifically, such use is only permitted for "backup" purposes, should your artwork no longer be available at its original URL. 
- **e. User Artwork Representation and Warranty.** For all User Artwork you create, you represent and warrant that you have full rights to the User Artwork and can provide the licenses explained herein. You shall not violate any copyright law, infringe on the rights of any party when publishing User Artwork, publish pornographic, or otherwise illegal or solicitous materials. You shall indemnify and hold Us, and all other users of the Volition blockchain, harmless against any third-party costs, claims, and attorneys’ fees arising from any User Artwork you create on the Volition blockchain. 
10. Copyright Infringement. If you believe that any User Artwork violates your copyright, please DO NOT CONTACT US. We do not (and cannot) review User Artwork before it is made public. As a reminder, the Services are provided by us as a gateway to the Volition blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger, and interactions with third parties is necessary to make a User Artwork publication. Accordingly, some third-party is hosting such work that you believe is infringing, so please locate the specific URL hosting the infringing work and contact that host to take down the infringing work.
11. Term and Termination. The Open Beta will run for an indefinite term. While the Open Beta is active, these TOS apply. We may terminate the entire Open Beta at any time with or without notice. Further, We reserve the right to terminate Your use, or anyone’s use, of the Services based on a violation of these TOS in Our sole discretion. We do not constantly, or even consistently, monitor use of the Services. We cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for whether we terminate a user’s use of the Services or not.
12. **General Disclaimer of Warranties**.

It should go without saying for an Open Beta, but our legal counsel reminded us that a disclaimer of warranties must be clearly stated in writing. So, please understand that: 

*The Services are in an early stage and not meant to be used for a commercial or particular purpose of any kind. This is a test and there will be bugs and kinks. Accordingly, the Services are provided “AS-IS” without any warranties of any kind. Cryptogogue disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied or at equity or law or under any statute or code including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.* 

13. **Hold Harmless and Limitation of Liability.**

Again, it should go without saying for an Open Beta, but our legal counsel reminded us that a limitation of liability must be clearly stated in writing. The Services are a test product. We will not be liable for any use of the Services. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that:  

*In no event will We, Our affiliates or their licensors, service providers, employees, agents, officers, or directors be liable for damages of any kind, under any legal theory, arising out of or in connection with your use, or inability to use, the Services, any websites linked to it, or any content from the Services or items obtained through use of the Services including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation personal injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of business or anticipated savings, loss of use, loss of goodwill, loss of data, and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if your damages are foreseeable or were somehow communicated to Us beforehand.* 

14. **Governing Law, Jutisdiction, Venue.** The TOS are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington without regard to conflict of laws principles. You consent to the jurisdiction of Washington, and any dispute arising under this agreement shall be settled and decided in King County. 
15. **Severability.** If any provision of the TOS is declared to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, the remaining portions will be enforced to the maximum extent allowed by law. If any provision is declared unenforceable because it is held to be unreasonable, then that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent reasonable.
